# Head First Design Patterns in Rust

![rust](rust.png)

[Head First Design Patterns (2020 2nd Edition)](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns) is written in `Java`, and in this repository I adapt all codes in `Rust`.

Besides pure code about design patterns, necessary documents covering OO (object-oriented) principles and idioms in `Rust` are also included. Throughout the README files, I will use **HFDP Book** to refer to [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X).

> `A Pattern` is a solution to a problem in a context.
