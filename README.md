# Head First Design Patterns in Rust

[Head First Design Patterns (2020 2nd Edition)](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns) is written in `Java`, and in this repository I adapt all codes in `Rust`.

Besides pure code about design patterns, necessary documents covering OO (object-oriented) principles and syntaxes are also included.
